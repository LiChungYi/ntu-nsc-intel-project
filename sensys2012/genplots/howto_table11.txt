How the figure for the data plot for table 11 was created:

1. create data file table11.dat

2. create a fig file using gnuplot by creating and running
     the file makeplot_table11

3. use xfig to create file for latex
     > xfig table11.fig
     then : file -> export -> "Combined PS/PDF/LaTeX (3 parts)"
     which will create :
      table11_pspdftex.eps
      table11_pspdftex.pdf
      table11.pspdftex

4. include the figure in latex with something like this:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\input{table11.pspdftex}
\caption{RMSE of (traffic, temporal, temperature}
\end{figure}
