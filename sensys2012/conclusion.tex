\section{Conclusion}  \label{sec:conc}
Factorization models is a powerful data-driven approach on filling missing data. In contrast to many knowledge driven approaches, for example, simply assume that closer sensor nodes have higher similarity, a factorization model learns the temporal-wise and sensor-wise similarity and summarizes the similarity as factors. We successfully incorporate the knowledge-driven idea into factorization models by proposed extra temporal and spatial regularizations. Moreover, we see that the spatial regularization is not suitable for all cases and should be applied with caution.  

Compared to all the existing approaches we studied, our TR-MF shows the best performance in both random and consecutive missing scenarios, and we propose the multivariate learning models MTR-MF and TF which can further improve the performance. Since the quality of missing data filling is crucial for the following learning task, as we discuss in Section ??,
