\section{Conclusion}  \label{sec:conc}
This paper proposes the factorization-based models for missing data estimation. In contrast to many existing knowledge driven approaches which makes stronger assumptions about the data (e.g. assume that the closer sensor nodes have higher similarity; or assume the so-called neighborhood area is at the same radius away from the center in every direction), our factorization model is data-driven that learns the inter-sensor and intra-sensor correlations through exploiting their latent similarity. Furthermore, we show that the additional knowledge such as the spatial relationships among sensor can seamlessly be incorporated into our model through regularization terms (e.g. STR-MF) if needed. Our experiments suggested that the temporal correlation is very helpful in general, while spatial information is useful only when the existing data are too little for the model to learn the inter-sensor relationships. Finally, we propose an $\Theta(KN + KR)$ multivariate tensor factorization model whose training complexity does not grow with its order, which allows the users to add arbitrary more dimensions or features into the imputation model without significantly increasing the computation burden.
We believe that the factorization models will become a very important kind of missing data recovery technique for WSN in the near future, and hopefully this paper can establish some foundation for more advanced research in this direction.
